## Source

The **Source** column in the data dictionary indicates where the column was added. The source can be one of the following:

- **Storage: ms-cm-exports** – Defined and controlled as part of Cost Management exports in the **ms-cm-exports** container in storage.
  > ℹ️ _Note that Cost Management exports use different schemas for different account types._
- **Storage: ingestion** – Added as part of transformation in Data Factory in the **ingestion** container in storage.
- **Power BI: CMExport** – Added in the **CMExport** query in Power BI.
- **Power BI: CMConnector** – Added in the **CMConnector** query in Power BI.
  > ⚠️ _This query is only used for backwards compatibility with the Cost Management connector. We recommend using the latest **CostDetails** query instead._
  >
  > ℹ️ _CMConnector inherits all columns from CMExport except for the renamed or transformed values. New columns may be added over time._
- **Power BI: Measure** – Added as a custom measure column in Power BI.
  > ℹ️ _Measures are added to the **CostDetails** data table in Power BI. This is a virtual query that references the latest query version. You can point this virtual query to another query using the advanced query editor._
